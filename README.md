# Sublime Text package for SEWL

This repository contains a Sublime Text package for *SEWL*, the *Spoton.net Editable Website Language*, used by the *WebEdit* content management system (marketed under the name *it’seeze*).

## Syntax

The syntax recognises the short fragment syntax as defining a symbol, allowing Sublime Text’s *Goto Symbol* and *Goto Definition* features to be used.

## Snippets

Snippets are defined for the most common `layout` and `option` formats, as well as for the `if`, `elseif`, `for`, and `foreach` keywords.
